	// Multi-Consumer-Single-Producer queue for void pointers.
	// It is used as a base for the templated queue able to store
	// pointers of any type.
	// Having the base separated helps to generate less code in
	// the final executable file, because it is not templated.
	// And the templated queue consists only of inlined 1-line
	// proxy calls to the base queue.

	// In order to make the queue semi-lock-free, the consumers
	// must exist as separate objects. They cache some important
	// values, which can be updated or read only under a lock.
	//
	// Semi-lock-free means, that the queue uses locks but
	// extremely rare (depending on sub-queue size). Most of the
	// time push and pop are lock-free and wait-free. That gives
	// significant performance improvement compared to a naive
	// completely lock-based queue, which takes a lock on each
	// push and each pop. The higher is contention, the more is
	// the difference. For instance, on some microbenchmarks this
	// queue is about 8 times faster than a lock-based queue.

	// is a lock-based list of lock-free queues of fixed size.
	//
	// The queue can't be a plain list, because it would need to
	// have separate head and tail in order to be able to pop
	// elements one by one. And these two values can't be updated
	// in a lock-free and wait-free manner. It is either
	// lock-free, but with spin-lock waits, or it is wait-free,
	// but completely based on locks.
	//
	// The queue can't be a lock-free array, because then it would
	// be bounded. Could store only limited number of items.
	//
	// This queue uses a lock-based list of lock-free bounded
	// sub-queues so while one sub-queue is not fully read by
	// consumers, its access is lock-free. The lock is taken only
	// when switch from one sub-queue to another, which is super
	// rare.
