	// Signal is a highly efficient way of blocking delivery of a
	// flag between threads.
	//
	// Firstly, signal send wakes up only one thread instead of
	// all the threads waiting for it. That helps to avoid
	// unnecessary wakeups, when the signal can only be handled by
	// one thread anyway. So called "thundering herd problem".
	//
	// Secondly, the signal can be received in a single
	// lock-unlock combination. No need for a separate clear()
	// call.
	//
	// Thirdly, the signal does not care about spurious wakeups.
	// So the caller's code must have a protection against that
	// if necessary. Usually it is not necessary, and in Signal
	// you don't pay for it.
	//
	// Fourthly, Signal attempts to do all the operations in a
	// lock-free way first.
